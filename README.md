## Reflection
This was a 1 week long project built during my 
third module at Turing School of Software and 
Design. Project goals included using technologies 
learned up until this point and familiarizing 
myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that 
looks the same but i ended up adding and removing some features that i find useful
 I started this process by 
 using the create-react-app boilerplate.

The technologies
 implemented in this project are React and a 
 significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. 
 I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate
  to minimize initial setup and invest more time 
  in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
